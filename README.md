# Code-Quiz

This website was created to generate a quiz to test users on their knowledge of JavaScript. The application has 5 questions. When you answer a question correctly, it will move onto the next question. When a question is answered incorrectly, it will deduct 10 seconds from the total 50 second allotted. If you run out of time before completely the quiz, you recieve a score of 0. If you answer all the question correctly before time runs out, then you recieve a score of the number of seconds left on the timer. Once the quiz has been completed, it will display your score and ask for your initials to record your score. 

I started this project by building a core HTML with a header, paragraph and a few ID's I knew I would be utilizing later. Next I began by declaring variables in my script file. After my variables were declared I began with the quiz timer. I created a time interval to track the time left on the quiz. Once this was working, I began by creating an object for my questions, answer options and the correct answer. Next I used 6 other functions to start my quiz, display answers, change answers, check my answers, to end the game, and next to record the score and user. After this, I began to style my website to make it easily read.

## Usage

The Use of this program is to test the user on their JavaScript knowledge.
